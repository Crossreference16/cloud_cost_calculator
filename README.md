# Cloud Cost Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Cloud Cost Dashboard is an automated AWS cost monitoring and reporting solution, designed to provide real-time visibility into cloud spending. The project provisions all resources using Terraform and leverages AWS managed services to deliver a public dashboard of AWS costs, along with automated cost alerts. This project demonstrates practical skills in Infrastructure as Code, serverless automation, and cloud cost management. This project can used by businesses in order for them to track cloud spending.

**Key objectives:**
- Automate cloud resource provisioning and monitoring via Terraformm
- Integrate AWS Lambda, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, and SNS
- Build a real-world solution for cost visibility and alerting



## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code:** All AWS resources (S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS) are defined and managed with Terraform for repeatability and version control.
- **Automated Cost Dashboard:** An S3 bucket hosts a static website that displays up-to-date AWS cost data, generated by Lambda.
- **Scheduled Cost Reporting:** AWS Lambda fetches weekly cost data from Cost Explorer, generates a new HTML dashboard, and uploads it to S3.
- **Cost Alerts:** CloudWatch monitors monthly AWS spend and triggers an SNS email alert if costs exceed a configurable threshold.
- **Public Access:** The dashboard is accessible via a public S3 website URL.



## Technical Architecture

**Terraform** provisions and configures:
- S3 bucket (static website hosting, public read access)
- Lambda function (Python, zipped and deployed)
- IAM roles and policies (for Lambda execution, S3 write, Cost Explorer access)
- CloudWatch Event Rule (schedules Lambda)
- CloudWatch Billing Alarm (monitors spend)
- SNS Topic (email notifications)

**AWS Lambda**:
- Runs on a schedule (weekly, or on demand)
- Uses Cost Explorer API to fetch current AWS spend
- Generates a new HTML dashboard with cost data
- Uploads the dashboard to S3 as `index.html`

**S3 Static Website**:
- Hosts the dashboard for public access
- Always displays the latest cost data after Lambda runs

**CloudWatch & SNS**:
- CloudWatch monitors monthly spend
- SNS sends email alerts if the threshold is exceeded



## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository and configure your AWS credentials.**
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
	```sh
	terraform init
	```
3. **Apply Terraform (twice):**
	- The first `terraform apply` may fail to apply the S3 bucket policy due to AWS propagation timing (permission error).
	- Run `terraform apply` a second time. The public bucket policy will be applied successfully, and the S3 website will be accessible.
4. **Enable Cost Explorer in AWS account.**
	- Heads up: the first time Cost Explorer is used, AWS may take up to 24 hours to prepare the billing data. Bare this in mind when replicating this solution
5. **Visit the S3 website URL (output by Terraform) to view the dashboard.**
6. **(Optional) Manually trigger the Lambda function in the AWS Console to update the dashboard immediately.**



## Cost Estimate

- **S3:** ~£0.02/month for 1GB storage and minimal requests (often free for personal/demo use)
- **Lambda:** £0 (well within AWS Free Tier for this usage)
- **CloudWatch:** £0.08/month for one alarm (if not in free tier)
- **SNS:** £0 (within free tier for email notifications)
- **Total:** Less than £0.01/day or ~£0.10/month for typical usage




## Skills Demonstrated

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS resource provisioning and automation
- Serverless architecture (Lambda)
- Cloud cost management and alerting
- IAM policy and security configuration
- S3 static website hosting
- Python scripting for AWS automation

## Notes & Customization

- All resources are created in `us-east-1`.
- Lambda and its IAM role require permissions for Cost Explorer and S3 write access.
- The dashboard updates automatically after Lambda runs.
- You can customize the cost threshold and alert email in `terraform.tfvars` or by editing the variables.
- The project is modular and can be extended for more advanced reporting or integrations.
